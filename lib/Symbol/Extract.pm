=head1 NAME

Symbol::Extract - Remove a symbol from the symbol table and place it's ref into
a variable.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This package allows you to remove symbols from the symbol table at compile
time, placing them into variables. The symbol can be in the current package or
any arbitrary packages.

=head1 SYNOPSYS

    my ($foo, $bar);
    use Symbol::Extract(
        foo       => \$foo,    # Remove the 'foo' sub from the current package, putting the ref into $foo
        A::B::bar => \$bar,    # Remove the 'bar' sub from the A::B package, putting the ref into $bar
    );

=head1 USAGE

    use Symbol::Extract $SYMBOL => $REF;

C<$SYMBOL> must be a string identifying the symbol. The symbol string must
include the sigil unless it is a subroutine. You can provide a fully qualified
symbol name, or it will be assumed the symbol is in C<$PACKAGE>.

C<$REF> must be a scalar ref, a reference to the symbol will be put into the
reference.
